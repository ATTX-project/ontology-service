execnet: rapid multi-Python deployment
========================================================

.. _execnet: http://codespeak.net/execnet

execnet_ provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
interpreters across version, platform and network barriers.  It provides
a minimal and fast API targetting the following uses:

* distribute tasks to local or remote CPUs
* write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
* write scripts to administer a bunch of exec environments

Features
------------------

* zero-install bootstrapping: no remote installation required!

* flexible communication: send/receive as well as
  callback/queue mechanisms supported

* simple serialization of python builtin types (no pickling)

* grouped creation and robust termination of processes

* well tested between CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython 2.5.1 and PyPy 1.1
  interpreters.

* fully interoperable between Windows and Unix-ish systems.
